\part{Chameleon}

This section is entirely copied from the Chameleon Web page. However
we have included where appropriate some updates. We like to mention
that we do not want to plagiarize, but are asking chameleon for
permission to redistribute this.

In any case please visit the CHameleon Web page as there is also more
information about other topics that we may not care about. Furthermore
we do not use Advanced Appliences, but use ansible instead as it is
independent from OpenStack and can be used with other frameworks.

If you prefer you can also go to the Chameleon Web site using the
following links. However we have improved some of the documentation
found in this document. We would like to get your feedback in case you
find errors or like to contribute tho this documentation.
