\chapter{Introduction}\label{S:p-intro}

This document is the first one in a series of documents that are
providing a comprehensive overview of Clouds, Big Data, and their
technologies and applications. Material from these volumes are used
selectively as part of this class.

\begin{IU}
They are developed within the Intelligent Systems Engineering department at
Indiana University. This courses are for students who are interested in
any component of the Masters or Ph.D. in Intelligent Systems
Engineering. It is an advanced elective class.
\end{IU}


The Series includes:

\section{Contributing}
\index{Contributing}

We encourage students of the classes to contribute to this document or
other volumes, provide corrections, and additions. This document is
managed on \verb|github.com| at

\URL{https://github.com/cloudmesh/book/}

\subsection{Class Contributions}

The current release version is held in the master branch.
Development versions will be held under a number of branches:

\begin{description}
\item[e222] Branch with contributions from students of the e222
  class. Merges to and from the \textit{latex} branch will be conducted
  on a daily bases by TA's.
\item[e516] Branch with contributions from students of the e616
  class. Merges to and from the \textit{latex} branch will be conducted
  on a daily bases by TA's.
\item[e616] Branch with contributions from students of the e616
  class. Merges to and from the \textit{latex} branch will be conducted
  on a daily bases by TA's.
\item[dev] Branch managed by Gregor and the TA's
\item[master] Branch that contains the current released version. This
  version is updated once a week from the branch \textit{latex}.
\end{description}

Contributions are to be conducted as pull requests. It is important to
keep the pull requests small and on a section or even paragraph
base. This helps avoiding conflicts at time of checkin and is a common
practice in large communities. It is not a good practice to work for
weeks on improvements and than issue the pull request. For sure things
will have changed and it will take you a long time to catch up.

The original document is based on selected material published and edited by Gregor von
Laszewski at the following Web page

\URL{https://cloudmesh.github.io/classes/}

Based on feedback from students the desire to have the material in
book format available was raised and we have implemented it.


\subsection{Community Contributions}
\index{Contributing}

It is easy to contribute to this document and we invite everyone to
improve the material. To do so you need to fork the repository from 

\URL{https://github.com/cloudmesh/book/}

and clone it. Make sure you check out the \textit{dev} branch. Then you
can modify information in the different files or add new sections. It
is important that you make changes based on sections and than for them
create a new pull request. This simplifies the review process. We will
typically want only one file to be changed. Aslo before you issue your
pull request make sure that no one else has already made changes. In
that case we ask you to integrate them into your document.

\subsection{Copy and Paste}


First, we do not recommend to just copy and paste ever without reading
the content. We recommend that you first read the entire section or
sometimes even the chapter. Only after you understand what the command
does, use it.

Second, to make it simple the handbook contains now a hyperlink to the
LaTeX source of a page if you look at the lower right of the page
itself. You can click on it and will be redirected to github. You can
than locate the section that defines the listing and copy from
there. This helps in cases you are unsure of spaces or minus signs or
other characters including line breaks.

Third, It is natural that some issues may exist, but be reminded that
the examples we have in the handbook have actually been tried
before. Spelling errors naturally can occur, and we would be greatful
in case you see an error help us fixing it. THisis especially the case
when it comes to version numbers. Often you may want to visit the
original source and check if the recommended version numbers listed in
the handbook re still up to date. This naturally has also the
consequence that if a new version is available that you must double
check the rest of the content in order not to overlook updates that
have been provided by the developers.



\section{Exercises}
\bigskip

\begin{exercise}
\label{E:Preface.1}

reviews and projects. 
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
\label{E:Preface.2}
 Contribute to this document while finding a
