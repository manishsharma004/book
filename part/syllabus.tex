\chapter{E516: Introduction to Cloud Computing}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We present the syllabus for the introduction to Cloud Computing course
taught at Indiana University that uses in part the material presented
in this document. The information includes the section or chapter
number, the name of the chapter or section, and the timeframe when it
is recommended to work through the material and the page number where
to find the material in this document. Please note that we will update
the document throughout the semester thus, pagenumbers will change. 

\section{Course Description}

This course describes the emerging cloud and big data technologies
within the world of distributed intelligent systems where each system
component has internal, and external sources of intelligence that are
subject to collective control. Examples are given from a wide variety
of applications. A project will allow students to dive into practical
issues after they have obtained a theoretical background.

\section{Course pre-requisites}

Python will be used as a Programming Languages. In some cases Java may
also be useful however it's use in class will be marginal. The class
will be using Linux commandline tools. Prior knowledge of Linux is of
advantage but not required.  Studnets are expected to have access to a
computer on which they can execute Linux easily. As the OS
requirements have recently increased we recommend a computer with 8GB
main memory and the ability to run virtualbox and/or containers. If it
turns out your machine is not capable enough we attempt to provide
access to IU linux machines.

\chapter{E616/I524: Advanced Cloud Computing}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This class is also known under the name {\em I524 Big Data
Applications and Open Source Software.}
 

We present the syllabus for the E616 course taught at Indiana
University that uses in part the material presented in this
document. The information includes the section or chapter number, the
name of the chapter or section, and the timeframe when it is
recommended to work through the material and the page number where to
find the material in this document. Please note that we will update
the document throughout the semester thus, page numbers will change.

\section{Course Description }

This course describes Cloud 3.0 in which DevOps, Microservices, and
Function as a Service is added to basic cloud computing. The
discussion is centered around the Apache Big Data Stack and a major
student project aimed at demonstrating integration of cloud
capabilities.

\section{Course pre-requisites}

Python will be used as a Programming Languages. It is expected that
you know a programming language. ENGR-E516 or an introduction to cloud
computing is recommended. Studnets are expected to have access to a
computer on which they can execute Linux easily. As the OS
requirements have recently increased we recommend a computer with 8GB
main memory and the ability to run virtualbox and/or containers. If it
turns out your machine is not capable enough we attempt to provide
access to IU linux machines.

\section{Course Registration}

I524 and E616 are identical. In this courses we will be focussing on
Advanced Cloud COmputing and Big Data Applications and Analytics.

  explore the Apache Web page and report on them. Continuation of
  earlier assigned homwework, including paper.
\item {\bf Week 6: DevOps:} Introduction to DevOps with Dokerfile and
  ansible
\item {\bf Week 7-14: Building a Kubernetes Cluster:} Residential
  students will be building a kubernetes cluster with 5
  servers. Online students could do that also, but need to simulate
  the cluster instead of using real hardware as it requires physical
  access to the hardware.

\item {\bf Week 7: Virtual Machines:} Introduction to OpenStack

This introduction has been continued in Week 4 of the class by
Geoffrey posting additional lectures.

\TODO{Tyler: include the links to Geoffreys lectures he presented, didn't see the slides presented on Thursday Feb 1,2018 about parallel computing, Amdahls Law I beleive was the first slide}


\subsection{Week 3. REST for Cloud computing }

We will be starting the class with introducing you to REST services
that provide a foundation for setting up services in the cloud and to
intercat with these services. As part of this class we will be
revisiting the REST services and use them to deploy them on a cloud as
well as develop our own AI based rest services in the second half of
the class. 

To get you started you need to read the follwoing sections:

An introduction to rest is provided in Section \ref{c:rest}. It also
provides a video recording of the material that was presented in
class.

\WHERE{\YES}{s:rest-intro}{}

Next, we present you with information on how to easily create a rest
service with FlaskRESTFUL a libraruy that makes the creation of web
services in python useing an object oriented approach easy. A Lab was
held that introduced you to developing such a service

\WHERE{\YES}{s:rest-flask}{}

A number of contributions from students have since been made including
the development effort for this lab. Links to this work can be found
at

\URL{https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/hid-sp18-505/everest}
Link will change to 
\URL{https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/hid-sp18-505/rest}
\URL{https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/hid-sp18-409/tree/master/rest}

\TODO{TYler: work with 505 to rename eve rest to rest, ubdate handbook
  when done}

Next, we introduced you to Python Eve which ia a framework that allows
you to define rest services with schemas. This is important as it
first allows you to easily define them while having just to do a very
minimal set of programming. Second, it allows you via Eve to make sure
you define a well designed data model that you can communicate to the
users of the REST service.

\WHERE{\YES}{s:eve-intro}{}

In the Lab that may spawn multiple weeks you will be developing a
Flask or Eve rest service.  The REST service retrieves information
form your computer and exposes it to the client. You can chose what
you like to present, but we want that all students in class do a
different information. TAs are working with you which information you
expose. A detailed Assignment is posted and coordinated in piazza
about this. YOu will be writing two services. One that uses flask
features, the other one that uses a database schema using Eve. The
entire class can openly collaborate with each other on this task. The
code is to be checcked in into your github repository. Information of
interrest include memory available of the computer, cpu type and so
on. This is not read from a text file but life queried.

\TODO{Tyler:Describe how each
  student gets a unique assignment. Coordinate that assignment.}

The link to the assignmnet in piazza is below, directions for each student will come out the week of Febuary 4, 2018. 
\URL{https://piazza.com/class/jc9dcfnbi045kv?cid=27}


\subsection{Weeks 2-3. Setting up your development environment}

It is important that you have a development environment to conduct the
class assignments. We recommend that you use virtual box and use
ubuntu. We have provided an extensive set of material for you to
achieve this. Please consult additional resources form the Web

The material includes:

\TODO{Tyler: please include links to the sections}

\begin{itemize}

\item Set up virtual box

\item Install ubuntu on the virtual box

\item Install an editor to develop python programs. We recommend
  pyCharm or simply emacs.

\item Using pyenv for multi version python installs

\end{itemize}

Technologies covered:	piazza,	git,	pycharm,	virtualbox,	pyenv,	python

Exersise: Continue to work on REST service.

\subsection{Week 5. Introduction to simple Containers}

We will be providing an introduction to containers and container
technologies. Excercises will include to run the REST services that we
developed earlier to start in containers and utilize them.

\subsection{Week 6. Introduction to Container Clusters}

We will be providing you with an introduction on how to not use one
server, but multiple servers to run containers on. This includes
docker swarm, kubernetes, (maybe mesos if time allows).
Exercises include the deployment of minikube that enables you to run
kubernetes on your computers. Alternatively access to a docker swarm
cluster may be provided.

\subsection{Week 7. Map Reduce}

In this section we will introduce you to the concept of Map reduce. We
will discuss systems such as Hadoop and Spark and how they differ. You
will be deploying via a container hadoop on your machine and use it to
gain hands on experience.

\subsection{Week 8. Overview of Cloud Services}

We will be introducing you how to use Cloud services offored via a
number of Cloud providers. Topics covered include: overview of AWS,
overview of Openstack, libcloud, and boto

\subsection{Week 9. Multi cloud environments}

We will teach you how to create a multi cloud shell while leveraging
an abstract programming interface to easily switch betwen multiple
clouds. You can practically participate in helping to develop
interfaces to AWS, Azure, and OpenStack. As you have also worked with
containers, you can develop such interfaces also for containers
including frameworks such as kubernetes. We will be using libcloud to
simplify the abstraction.
	
\subsection{Week 10. Cloud Data and Applications}

We will cover a number of Application examples for Cloud computing. In
the second part we will focus on CLoud Data Services and how we access
data on the cloud. Exercises will include moving data between data
services. THis includes your own computer, box and google which both
are offered at IU.


\subsection{Other weeks}

All excersises in these weeks will develop REST services that {\em
  expose} machine leraning algorithms as service. Data will be either
passed along directly through parameters to the call, or on case of
large data a URL to the data source. The lessons from the previous
weeks will be helping you to achive this. It is not sufficient to just
run the algorithms, but you must be integrating them into a REST service.

Other weeks are not yet included here but will cover Artificial
Intelligence.
