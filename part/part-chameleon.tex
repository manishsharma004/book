\chapter{Overview}


\FILENAME

This section is copied from the Chameleon Web page. However we have
included where appropriate some updates. We like to mention that we do
not want to plagiarize, but are asking chameleon for permission to
redistribute this.

Chameleon is an experimental testbed for Computer Science funded by the
NSF FutureCloud program. Chameleon is built over two sites, University
of Chicago and TACC, offering a total of over 550 nodes and 5 PB of
space in twelve
\href{https://www.chameleoncloud.org/about/hardware-description/}{Standard
Cloud Unit (SCU) racks}. To effectively support Computer Science
experiments Chameleon offers bare metal reconfigurability on most of the
hardware. To provide easy access to educational users, three SCUs at
TACC (a quarter of the testbed) are configured with OpenStack KVM. You
can read more about
Chameleon~\href{https://www.chameleoncloud.org/about/chameleon/}{here}.

Chameleon is broadly available to members of the US Computer Science
research community and its international collaborators working in the
open community on cloud research. The expectation is that any research
performed on Chameleon will result in publication in a broadly
available journal or conference.

In order to promote fairness to all users, we have~the following set of
Best Practices for using Chameleon~bare metal partitions:

\begin{description}
\item
  \item[Think Small for Development and class use:] If you are just developing or
  prototyping a system, and not yet running experiments at scale, use
  only as many nodes as you actually need (e.g., many projects can be
  developed and tested on 3-4 nodes), and try to take short
  reservations. Start with hours first and do not let your VMs
  unnecessarily run for long unused periods. 
\item
  \item[Automate deployments:] You can always snapshot your work/images
  between sessions using the
  \href{https://www.chameleoncloud.org/docs/user-guides/ironic/\#snapshotting_an_instance}{snapshotting
  instructions} to simplify the redeployment of your environment during
  the next work session. You can also use scripting and environment
  customization to make it easier to redeploy images. An additional
  benefit of automation is that it makes it easier for you to reproduce
  your work and eventually~share it~with colleagues within your lab and
  other collaborators.
\item [Think Big for Experimentation:] Once you are ready to experiment you
  will want to test your experimental setup on increasingly larger
  scales. This is possible by taking an advance reservation for many
  resources for a relatively short time. The more resources you need,
  the more likely it is that you will need to run experiments at a less
  attractive time (e.g., during the weekend) --- here's where automation
  will also help. In justified cases, we will support reserving even the
  whole bare metal testbed.

\section{More Information}

In any case please visit the Chameleon Web page as there is also more
information about other topics that we may not care about. Furthermore
we do not use Advanced Appliences, but use ansible instead as it is
independent from OpenStack and can be used with other frameworks.

If you prefer you can also go to the Chameleon Web site using the
following links. However we have improved some of the documentation
found in this document. We would like to get your feedback in case you
find errors or like to contribute tho this documentation.
