\chapter{Course Proposals}

\TODO{THIS CHAPTER WILL CHANGE}

In this section we outline a number of course proposals that can be
derived form the material posted here. These proposals are useful for
faculty members that like to teach Big Data, Cloud Computing and
Advanced Cloud Computing. When looking at a class our curriculum, it
is important that students understand that the area is fast evolving
and that changes to the curriculum are to be expected even throughout
the semester. Thus if a syllabus is posted it is to be expected that
is changes and gets adapted.
