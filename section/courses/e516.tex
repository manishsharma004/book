This will significantly change.

Course number at Indiana University ENGR-E516 - 2018

\subsection{Course Description}

This course describes the emerging world of distributed intelligent
systems where each system component has internal, and external sources
of intelligence that are subject to collective control. Examples are
given from computers, networks, vehicle systems, digital
manufacturing, and robotics. Performance and fault tolerance and
system management are discussed.

\subsection{Course pre-requisites}

Python will be used as a Programming Languages. In some cases Java may
also be useful however it's use in class will be marginal. One of
I523, I524, ENGR-E516, E616 or existing knowledge to introduction to
cloud computing recommended. The class will be using Linux commandline
tools. Prior knowledge of Linux is of advantage but not required.
Studnets are expected to have access to a computer on which they can
execute Linux easily. As the OS requirements have recently increased
we recommend a computer with 8GB main memory and the ability to run
virtualbox and/or containers. If it turns out your machine is not
capable enough we attempt to provide access to IU linux machines.

\subsection{Justification}

Intelligent Systems Engineering is a department and a new major at
Indiana University. This course is for students who are interested in
any component of the Masters or Ph.D. in Intelligent Systems
Engineering. It is an advanced elective class.
