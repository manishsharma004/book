\FILENAME

This section covers 51 values of X and an overall study of Big data that
emerged from a NIST (National Institute for Standards and Technology)
study of Big data. The section covers the NIST Big Data Public Working
Group (NBD-PWG) Process and summarizes the work of five subgroups:
Definitions and Taxonomies Subgroup, Reference Architecture Subgroup,
Security and Privacy Subgroup, Technology Roadmap Subgroup and the
Requirements andUse Case Subgroup. 51 use cases collected in this
process are briefly discussed with a classification of the source of
parallelism and the high and low level computational structure. We
describe the key features of this classification.

\subsection{Overview of NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG)
Process and1
Results}\label{overview-of-nist-big-data-public-working-group-nbd-pwg-process-and-results}

This unit covers the NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG)
Process and summarizes the work of five subgroups: Definitions and
Taxonomies Subgroup, Reference Architecture Subgroup, Security and
Privacy Subgroup, Technology Roadmap Subgroup and the Requirements and

\subsubsection{Introduction to NIST Big Data Public Working Group
(NBD-PWG)
Process}\label{introduction-to-nist-big-data-public-working-group-nbd-pwg-process}

The focus of the (NBD-PWG) is to form a community of interest from
industry, academia, and government, with the goal of developing a
consensus definitions, taxonomies, secure reference architectures, and
technology roadmap. The aim is to create vendor-neutral, technology and
infrastructure agnostic deliverables to enable big data stakeholders to
pick-and-choose best analytics tools for their processing and
visualization requirements on the most suitable computing platforms and
clusters while allowing value-added from big data service providers and
flow of data between the stakeholders in a cohesive and secure manner.

\subsubsection{Definitions and Taxonomies
Subgroup}\label{definitions-and-taxonomies-subgroup}

The focus is to gain a better understanding of the principles of Big
Data. It is important to develop a consensus-based common language and
vocabulary terms used in Big Data across stakeholders from industry,
academia, and government. In addition, it is also critical to identify
essential actors with roles and responsibility, and subdivide them into
components and sub-components on how they interact/ relate with each
other according to their similarities and differences.

For Definitions: Compile terms used from all stakeholders regarding the
meaning of Big Data from various standard bodies, domain applications,
and diversified operational environments. For Taxonomies: Identify key
actors with their roles and responsibilities from all stakeholders,
categorize them into components and subcomponents based on their
similarities and differences. In particular data Science and Big Data
terms are discussed.

\subsubsection{Reference Architecture
Subgroup}\label{reference-architecture-subgroup}

The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus-based approach
to orchestrate vendor-neutral, technology and infrastructure agnostic
for analytics tools and computing environments. The goal is to enable
Big Data stakeholders to pick-and-choose technology-agnostic analytics
tools for processing and visualization in any computing platform and
cluster while allowing value-added from Big Data service providers and
the flow of the data between the stakeholders in a cohesive and secure
manner. Results include a reference architecture with well defined
components and linkage as well as several exemplars.


\video{Usecases}{10:05}{Architecture}{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4ylW0vztDw} 


\subsubsection{Security and Privacy
Subgroup}\label{security-and-privacy-subgroup}

The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus secure reference
architecture to handle security and privacy issues across all
stakeholders. This includes gaining an understanding of what standards
are available or under development, as well as identifies which key
organizations are working on these standards. The Top Ten Big Data
Security and Privacy Challenges from the CSA (Cloud Security Alliance)
BDWG are studied. Specialized use cases include Retail/Marketing, Modern
Day Consumerism, Nielsen Homescan, Web Traffic Analysis, Healthcare,
Health Information Exchange, Genetic Privacy, Pharma Clinical Trial Data
Sharing, Cyber-security, Government, Military and Education.


\video{Usecases}{9:51}{Security}{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHrHk-GvruY} 


\subsubsection{Technology Roadmap
Subgroup}\label{technology-roadmap-subgroup}

The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus vision with
recommendations on how Big Data should move forward by performing a good
gap analysis through the materials gathered from all other NBD
subgroups. This includes setting standardization and adoption priorities
through an understanding of what standards are available or under
development as part of the recommendations. Tasks are gather input from
NBD subgroups and study the taxonomies for the actors' roles and
responsibility, use cases and requirements, and secure reference
architecture; gain understanding of what standards are available or
under development for Big Data; perform a thorough gap analysis and
document the findings; identify what possible barriers may delay or
prevent adoption of Big Data; and document vision and recommendations.

\subsubsection{Interfaces subgroup}\label{interfaces-subgroup}

This subgroup is working on the following document: \emph{NIST Big Data
Interoperability Framework: Volume 8, Reference Architecture Interface}.

This document summarizes interfaces that are instrumental for the
interaction with Clouds, Containers, and HPC systems to manage virtual
clusters to support the NIST Big Data Reference Architecture (NBDRA).
The Representational State Transfer (REST) paradigm is used to define
these interfaces allowing easy integration and adoption by a wide
variety of frameworks. . This volume, Volume 8, uses the work performed
by the NBD-PWG to identify objects instrumental for the NIST Big Data
Reference Architecture (NBDRA) which is introduced in the NBDIF: Volume
6, Reference Architecture.

This presentation was given at the \emph{2nd NIST Big Data Public
Working Group (NBD-PWG) Workshop} in Washington DC in June 2017. It
explains our thoughts on deriving automatically a refernce architecture
form the Refernce Architecture Interface specifications directly from
the document.

\subsubsection{Requirements and Use Case Subgroup
Introduction}\label{requirements-and-use-case-subgroup-introduction}

The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus list of Big Data
requirements across all stakeholders. This includes gathering and
understanding various use cases from diversified application
domains.Tasks are gather use case input from all stakeholders; derive
Big Data requirements from each use case; analyze/prioritize a list of
challenging general requirements that may delay or prevent adoption of
Big Data deployment; develop a set of general patterns capturing the
`'essence'' of use cases (not done yet) and work with Reference
Architecture to validate requirements and reference architecture by
explicitly implementing some patterns based on use cases. The progress
of gathering use cases (discussed in next two units) and requirements
systemization are discussed.
