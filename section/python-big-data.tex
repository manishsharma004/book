\section{Python for Big Data}\label{python-for-big-data}

\subsection{An Example with Pandas, NumPy and
Matplotlib}\label{an-example-with-pandas-numpy-and-matplotlib}

In this example, we will download some traffic citation data for the
city of Bloomington, IN, load it into Python and generate a histogram.
In doing so, you will be exposed to important Python libraries for
working with big data such as \href{www.numpy.org}{numpy},
\href{pandas.pydata.org}{pandas} and \href{matplotlib.org}{matplotlib}.

\subsubsection{Set Up Directories and Get Test
Data}\label{set-up-directories-and-get-test-data}

Data.gov is a government portal for open data and the
\href{https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?organization_type=City+Government\&organization=city-of-bloomington\&_organization_limit=0}{city
of Bloomington, Indiana makes available a number of datasets there}.

We will use traffic citations data for 2016.

To start, let's create a separate directory for this project and
download the CSV data:

\begin{verbatim}
$ cd ~/projects/i524
$ mkdir btown-citations
$ cd btown-citations
$ wget https://data.bloomington.in.gov/dataset/c543f0c1-1e37-46ce-a0ba-e0a949bd248a/resource/24841976-fd35-4483-a2b4-573bd1e77cfb/download/2016-first-quarter-citations.csv
\end{verbatim}

Depending on your directory organization, the above might be slightly
different for you.

If you go to the link to data.gov for Bloomington above, you will see
that the citations data is organized per quarter, so there are a total
of four files. Above, we downloaded the data for the first quarter. Go
ahead and download the remaining three files with \texttt{wget}.

In this example, we will use three modules, \texttt{numpy},
\texttt{pandas} and \texttt{matplotlib}. If you set up
\texttt{virtualenv} as described in the
Python tutorial \textless{}python\_intro\textgreater{}, the first two of
these are already installed for you. To install \texttt{matplotlib},
make sure you've activated your \texttt{virtualenv} and use
\texttt{pip}:

\begin{verbatim}
$ source ~/ENV/bin/activate
$ pip install matplotlib
\end{verbatim}

If you are using a different distribution of Python, you will need to
make sure that all three of these modules are installed.

\subsubsection{Load Data in Pandas}\label{load-data-in-pandas}

From the same directory where you saved the citations data, let's start
the Python interpreter and load the citations data for Q1 2016

\begin{verbatim}
$ python
>>> from __future__ import division, print_function
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> data = pd.read_csv('2016-first-quarter-citations.csv')
\end{verbatim}

If the first \texttt{import} statement seems confusing, take a look at
the Python tutorial \textless{}python\_intro\textgreater{}. The next
three \texttt{import} statements load each of the modules we will use in
this example. The final line uses Pandas' \texttt{read\_csv} function to
load the data into a Pandas \texttt{DataFrame} data structure.

\subsubsection{Working with DataFrames}\label{working-with-dataframes}

You can verify that you are working with a \texttt{DataFrame} and use
some of its methods to take a look at the structure of the data as
follows:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> type(data)
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
>>> data.index
Int64Index([  0,   1,   2,   3,   4,   5,   6,   7,   8,   9,
...
197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206],
dtype='int64', length=200)
>>> data.columns
Index([u'Citation Number', u'Date Issued', u'Time Issued', u'Location ',
u'District', u'Cited Person Age', u'Cited Person Sex',
u'Cited Person Race', u'Offense Code', u'Offense Description',
u'Officer Age', u'Officer Sex', u'Officer Race'],
dtype='object')
>>> data.dtypes
Citation Number                object
Date Issued                    object
Time Issued                    object
Location                       object
District                       object
Cited Person Age              float64
Cited Person Sex               object
Cited Person Race              object
Offense Code                   object
Offense Description            object
Officer Age                   float64
Officer Sex                    object
Officer Race                   object
dtype: object
>>> data.shape
(200, 15)
\end{verbatim}

As you can see from the \texttt{columns} field, when the CSV file was
read, the header line was used to populate the name of the columns in
the \texttt{DataFrame}. In addition, you will notice that
\texttt{read\_csv} correctly inferred the data type of some columns like
\emph{Age}, but not of others like \emph{Date Issued} and \emph{Time
Issued}. \texttt{read\_csv} is a very customizable function and in
general, you can correct issues like this using the \texttt{dtype} and
\texttt{converters} parameters. In this specific case, it makes more
sense to combine the \emph{Date Issued} and \emph{Time Issued} columns
into a new column containing a time stamp. We will see how to do this
shortly.

You can also look at the data itself with the \texttt{DataFrame}'s
\texttt{head()} and \texttt{tail()} methods:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> data.head()
<Output omitted for brevity>
>>> data.tail()
<Output omitted for brevity>
\end{verbatim}

In addition to letting you examine your data easily, \texttt{DataFrame}s
have methods that help you deal with missing values:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> data = data.dropna(how='any')
>>> data.shape
\end{verbatim}

Adding columns to the data is also easy. Here, we add two columns.
First, a
\href{https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html}{datetime} column
that is a combination of the \texttt{Date\ Issued} and
\texttt{Time\ Issued} columns originally in the data. Second, a column
identifying what day of the week each citation was given. To understand
this example better, take a look at the Python docs for the
\texttt{strptime} and \texttt{strftime} functions in the
\texttt{datetime} module linked above.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> from datetime import datetime
>>> data['DateTime Issued'] = data.apply(
...  lambda row: datetime.strptime(row['Date Issued'] + ':' + row['Time Issued'], '%m/%d/%y:%I:%M %p'), axis=1
... )
>>> data.columns
>>> data['Day of Week Issued'] = data.apply(
...  lambda row: datetime.strftime(row['DateTime Issued'], '%A'), axis=1
... )
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Plotting with Matplotlib and
NumPy}\label{plotting-with-matplotlib-and-numpy}

Let's say we want to see how many citations were given each day of the
week. We gather the data first:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']
>>> dow_data = [days.index(dow) for dow in data['Day of Week Issued']]
>>> dow_data
<Output omitted for brevity>
\end{verbatim}

Then we use \texttt{matplotlib} to plot it:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> fig = plt.figure()
>>> ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1)
>>> plt.hist(dow_data, bins=len(days))
>>> plt.xticks(range(len(days)), days)
>>> plt.show()
\end{verbatim}

You should see something like this on your screen:

\includegraphics[width=4.16667in]{dow.png}

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{More \emph{DataFrame} Manipulation and
Plotting}{More DataFrame Manipulation and Plotting}}\label{more-dataframe-manipulation-and-plotting}

\texttt{DataFrame}s and \texttt{numpy} give us other ways to manipulate
data. For example, we can plot a histogram of the ages of violators like
this:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> ages = data['Cited Person Age'].astype(int)
>>> fig = plt.figure()
>>> ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1)
>>> plt.hist(ages, bins=np.max(ages) - np.min(ages))
>>> plt.show()
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=4.16667in]{ages.png}

Surprisingly, we see some 116 year-old violators! This is probably an
error in the data, so we can remove these data points easily and plot
the histogram again:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> ages = ages[ages < 100]
>>> fig = plt.figure()
>>> ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1)
>>> plt.hist(ages, bins=np.max(ages) - np.min(ages))
>>> plt.show()
\end{verbatim}

\includegraphics[width=4.16667in]{ages-filtered.png}

\subsubsection{Saving Plots to PDF}\label{saving-plots-to-pdf}

Oftentimes, you will want to save your \texttt{matplotlib} graph as a
PDF or an SVG file instead of just viewing it on your screen. For both,
we need to create a \texttt{figure} and plot the histogram as before:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> fig = plt.figure()
>>> ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1)
>>> plt.hist(ages, bins=np.max(ages) - np.min(ages))
\end{verbatim}

Then, instead of calling \texttt{plt.show()} we can invoke
\texttt{plt.savefig()} to save as SVG:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> plt.savefig('hist.svg')
\end{verbatim}

If we want to save the figure as PDF instead, we need to use the
\texttt{PdfPages} module together with \texttt{savefig()}:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> import matplotlib.patches as mpatches
>>> from matplotlib.backends.backend_pdf import PdfPages   
>>> pp = PdfPages('hist.pdf')
>>> fig.savefig(pp, format='pdf')
>>> pp.close()
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Next Steps and Exercises}\label{next-steps-and-exercises}

There is a lot more to working with \texttt{pandas}, \texttt{numpy} and
\texttt{matplotlib} than we can show you here, but hopefully this
example has piqued your curiosity.

Don't worry if you don't understand everything in this example. For a
more detailed explanation on these modules and the examples we did,
please take a look at the tutorials below. The \texttt{numpy} and
\texttt{pandas} tutorials are mandatory if you want to be able to use
these modules, and the \texttt{matplotlib} gallery has many useful code
examples.
