# HADOOP	

Hadoop is an open source framework for storage and processing of large datasets
on commodity clusters. Hadoop internally uses its own file system called 
HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System). In this tutorial our main focus is on 
using Hadoop 2.6.0 version along with the Yarn resource manager. We will be 
focusing more on the Hadoop installation in this chapter. 

## INSTALLATION OF HADOOP

First we will take a look on how to install Hadoop 2.6.0 on Ubuntu 16.04. We may
need a prior folder structure to do the installation properly. 

### Create Directories

```
$ mkdir ~/software
$ mkdir ~/zips
```

We keep these two folders to keep the softwares in one folder and the other 
folder will keep the original zip files.
