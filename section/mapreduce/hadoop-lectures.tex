\TODO{Gregor: Update Video Hadoop Urls to Youtube Urls}

This section covers an introduction to Spark that is split up
into eight parts. We discuss Spark background, RDD operations,
Shark, Hadoop ML ,Hadoop vs Other Frameworks.

\section{PageRank}

In this section we discuss about a real world problem that can be solved using the MapReduce
technique. PageRank is a problem solved by the earliest stages of the Google.inc. In this
section we discuss about the theoretical background about this problem and we discuss how this
can be solved using the map reduce concepts.
