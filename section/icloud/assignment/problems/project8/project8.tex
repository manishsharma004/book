\section*{Harp Mini\-Batch Kmeans}

\subsection*{Goal}

The goal for this exercise is to implement Harp Mini-batch Kmeans
from scratch (See~\hyperlink{link_project8}{Useful Links}). 

\subsection*{Deliverables}
Zip your source code and report as username\_mbkmeans.zip. Please submit this
file to the Canvas Assignments page.

\subsection*{Evaluation}

The point total for this exercise is 6, where the distribution is as
follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Completeness of your code (5 points)
\item In the report, describe your implementation and the output. (1 points)
\end{itemize}

You can get up to 4 bonus points based on your extra efforts.

\section*{Bonus credits}

Some options you may consider to get extra credits: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Perform experiments on various (small, medium, large, etc)
  datasets
\item Test your algorithm on at least 2 nodes on FutureSystem.
\item Implement mini-batch kmeans using other tools/platforms (Spark,
  Flink, etc) and compare the performance between different
  tools/platforms (See~\hyperlink{link_project8}{Useful Links}).
\end{itemize}

You are encouraged to explore other options to get extra
credits. Remember to present all of your extra work in the report.
 
\subsection*{Dataset}

You can implement a script to generate data randomly as your input
datasets.  You are also free to use public datasets such as RCV1-v2
(See~\hyperlink{link_project8}{Useful Links}).
  
\subsection*{Mini-batch Kmeans}

You can refer to the paper for sequential mini-batch kmeans
algorithm. You will need to design how to parallelize the algorithm so
that it can run with large scale datasets on distributed computing
environment.
