\chapter{Project 3}\label{project-3}

Project 3 asks you to implement a bioinformatics application using
Hadoop (Map only) MapReduce framework and write a report about the data
flow and your observations of the program.

You are required to turn in the following items in a zip file
(username\_HadoopBlast.zip) in this assignment:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The source code of Hadoop Blast you implemented.
\item
  Technical report (username \_HadoopBlast\_report.docx) that answers
  the following questions. - What is Hadoop Distributed Cache and how is
  it used in this program? - Write the two lines that put and get values
  from Distributed cache. Also include the method and class information.
  - In previous projects we used Hadoop's TextInputFormat to feed in the
  file splits line by line to map tasks. In this program, however, we
  want to feed in a whole file to a single map task. What is the
  technique used to achieve this? Also, briefly explain what are the key
  and value pairs you receive as input to a map task and what methods
  are responsible for producing these pairs? - Do you think this
  particular implementation will work if the input files are larger than
  the default HDFS block size? Briefly explain why. [Hint: you can
  test what will happen by concatenating the same input file multiple
  times to create a larger input file in the resources/blast\_input
  folder] - If you wanted to extend this program such that all output
  files will be concatenated into a single file, what key and value
  pairs would you need to emit from the map task? Also, how would you
  use these in the reduce that you would need to add?
\item
  The 4 output FASTA files -- celllines\_1.fa to celllines\_4.fa.
\end{itemize}

Points will be reduced (maximum 0.5 points) if the filename or directory
structure are different from instructed above.

Write an HBase FreqIndexBuilder program to build an inverted index table
which has the unique term's occurrences in all documents from the
clueWeb09 dataset. Zip your source code, results and report in a file
named username\_project5.zip. Submit this file to the Canvas submission
page.

\chapter{Project 6}\label{project-6}

After having familiarized yourself with the ``HBase Building an Inverted
Index'' homework and ``PageRank algorithms'' homework, you are ready to
use these applications to test the search engine function from the
packaged executable.

\section{Deliverables}\label{deliverables}

\chapter{Project 7}\label{project-7}

The goal of this project is to familiarize yourself with the concept of
map-collective applications. Harp is similar to MapReduce in terms of
programming with the exception that it provides collective communication
support across map tasks.
