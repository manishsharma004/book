\chapter{Exercise 2 - Page Rank}\label{project-2}

You are required to turn in the following items in a zip file
(username\_HadoopPageRank.zip) in this assignment:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The source code of Hadoop PageRank you implemented.
\item Technical report (username\_HadoopPageRank\_report.docx) that
  contains:
  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The description of the main steps and data flow in your program.
  \item
    The output file (username\_HadoopPageRank\_output.txt) which
    contains the first 10 urls along with their ranks.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Exercise 3 - Map Reduce}\label{project-3}

Exercise 3 asks you to implement a bioinformatics application using
Hadoop (Map only) MapReduce framework and write a report about the data
flow and your observations of the program.

You are required to turn in the following items in a zip file
(username\_HadoopBlast.zip) in this assignment:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The source code of Hadoop Blast you implemented.
\item
  Technical report (username \_HadoopBlast\_report.docx) that answers
  the following questions. - What is Hadoop Distributed Cache and how is
  it used in this program? - Write the two lines that put and get values
  from Distributed cache. Also include the method and class information.
  - In previous exercises we used Hadoop's TextInputFormat to feed in the
  file splits line by line to map tasks. In this program, however, we
  want to feed in a whole file to a single map task. What is the
  technique used to achieve this? Also, briefly explain what are the key
  and value pairs you receive as input to a map task and what methods
  are responsible for producing these pairs? - Do you think this
  particular implementation will work if the input files are larger than
  the default HDFS block size? Briefly explain why. [Hint: you can
  test what will happen by concatenating the same input file multiple
  times to create a larger input file in the resources/blast\_input
  folder] - If you wanted to extend this program such that all output
  files will be concatenated into a single file, what key and value
  pairs would you need to emit from the map task? Also, how would you
  use these in the reduce that you would need to add?
\item
  The 4 output FASTA files -- celllines\_1.fa to celllines\_4.fa.
\end{itemize}

Points will be reduced (maximum 0.5 points) if the filename or directory
structure are different from instructed above.

The point total for this exercise is 3, where the distribution is as
follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Completeness of your code and output (1 points)
\item
  Correctness of written report (2 points)
\end{itemize}
