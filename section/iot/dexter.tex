\section{Creating an SD Card}\label{creating-an-sd-card}

\subsection{OSX}\label{osx}

First, install Etcher from \href{https://etcher.io/}{etcher.io} which
allows you to flash images onto the SD card. When flashing make sure you
only attach one USB SD card reader/wroiter or use the build in SD card
slot provided in some Mac's.

The version of etcher we used is

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \href{https://github.com/resin-io/etcher/releases/download/v1.1.1/Etcher-1.1.1-darwin-x64.dmg}{Etcher-1.1.1-darwin-x64.dmg}
\end{itemize}

Make sure to check if there is a newer version

\subsection{Dexter Rasbian}\label{dexter-rasbian}

Dexter provides a special image that contains the drivers and sample
programs for the GrovePi shield. We had some issues installing it on a
plain Raspbian OS, thus we recommend that you use dexters version if you
use the GrovePi shield. It is available from

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \href{http://sourceforge.net/projects/dexterindustriesraspbianflavor/}{Google
  Drive}
\item
  \href{http://sourceforge.net/projects/dexterindustriesraspbianflavor/}{Sourceforge}
\end{itemize}

Detailed information on how to generate an SD card while using your OS
is provided at

\subsection{Github}\label{github}

Dexter maintains a github repository that includes their code for the
shield and many other projects at

The python related programs are in a subdirectory at

  \URL{https://github.com/DexterInd/GrovePi/tree/master/Software/Python}

Here you find many programs and for a complete list visit that link.
Dependent on the sensors and actuators you have, inspect some programs.
Some of them may inspire you to purchase some sensors.

We have developed a partial library of GrovePi module classes at
