\chapter{Apache Hadoop 3.0.1 using Docker}

Apache Hadoop 3.0.1 is the latest release (25 March, 2018) which includes significant enhancements over the previous version of Hadoop 2.x.

This section provides a separated Dockerfile to build hadoop 3.0.1 but the configurations and examples are same except a few minor changes which are:

- CentOS 7 
- systemctl
- Java SE Development Kit 8

\section{Draft: Building Hadoop 3.0.1 using Docker}

Build a docker image by Dockerfile from:

\begin{lstlisting}
mkdir hadoop3.0.1
cd hadoop3.0.1
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudmesh/book/master/examples/docker/hadoop/3.0.1/Dockerfile
docker build -t cloudmesh/hadoop:3.0.1 .
\end{lstlisting}

The complete docker image for Hadoop 3.0.1 consumes the storage size of 1.5GB.

\begin{lstlisting}
\$ docker images
REPOSITORY                      TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
cloudmesh/hadoop                3.0.1               ba2c51f94348        20 hours ago        1.5GB
\end{lstlisting}


\section{Start a Hadoop Container with Interactive Shell}

\begin{lstlisting}
docker run -it cloudmesh/hadoop:3.0.1 /etc/bootstrap.sh -bash
%docker run -it lee212/e222 /etc/bootstrap.sh -bash
\end{lstlisting}

The details of the new version is available from the official site here: http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.0.1/index.html

\section{Examples}

The statistics and PageRank examples are identical to the Hadoop 2.7.5 on Docker~\ref{c:hadoop-docker}.
