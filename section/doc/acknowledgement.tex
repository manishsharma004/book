\section{Acknowledgements}
\label{S:acknowledgements}

In many cases you want to include an acknowledgement section. In some cases you may be tempted to eliminate this section as you think you are out of space and the acknowledgement section may give you some additional space. This however is the wrong strategy and you should not do this. Instead you should shorten your paper elsewhere and leave enough space for acknowledgements.

In some cases where you get financial support from a university for a project such as from NIH or NSF specific information {\bf must} be included. The best way is to verify with your coauthors. Additional acknowledgements may have to be added and you need te evaluate if for example significant help on the paper warrants co-authorship.

An issue that we have seen often is for example when a professor has helped significantly on the paper but is not properly acknowledged. This can even lead to the professor asking you to remove him from the acknowledgement. A bad acknowledh]gement example is the following:

\begin{quote}
We like to thank Professor Zweistein for his help in compiling  the \LaTeX paper.
\end{quote}

We do not think that the professor will be happy with this acknowledgement as it sounds like the only thing that was provided was the help on LaTeX that you should have done anyways without the help of the professor. Ask yourself, if he introduced you to the field, has helped you with preparing the text, has given you insights, has corrected things in your paper, made suggestions. So instead of the above maybe a more general term such as \textit{helped with the paper} would be more appropriate. If not leaving it off is more appropriate. In some cases you may wan to invite your professor to become a co-author.
