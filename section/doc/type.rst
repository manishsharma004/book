Communicating Research
======================

It is important to have tools that allow us to communicate. 


Blogs
-----

blog:
    noun, a regularly updated website or web page, typically
    one run by an individual or small group, that is written
    in an informal or conversational style.

Advantages:

* encourages spontaneous posts
* encourages small short contributions
* chronologically ordered
* standard software exists to set up blogs
* online services exists to set up blogs
  
Disadvantages:

* structuring data is difficult (some blog software support it)
* not suitable for formal development of a paper
* often lack of sophisticated track change features
* no collaborative editing features

  
Sphinx
------

Sphinx (http://www.sphinx-doc.org/) is a tool that to create
integrated documentation from a markup language whlie.

Advantages:

* output formats: html, LaTeX, PDF, ePub
* integrates well with directory structure
* powerful markup language (reStructuredText)
* can be hosted on github via github pages
* can integare other renderers such as Markdown
* automatic table of content, tebale of index
* code documentation integration
* search
* written in python and using bash, so extensions and custom automation are possible
  
Disadvantage:

* requires compile step
* When using markdown github can render individual page

Others:

* Read the Docs (https://readthedocs.org/)
* Doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/)
* MkDocs (http://www.mkdocs.org/)

Notebooks
---------

Jupyter
^^^^^^^

The Jupyter Notebook (http://jupyter.org/) is an open-source web
application allowing users to create and share documents that contain
live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Use cases
include data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation,
statistical modeling, machine learning.

Advantages:

* Integrates with python
* Recently other programming languages have been integrated
* Allows experimenting with settings
* Allows a form of literate programming while mixing documentation
  with code
* automatically renders on github
* comes with web service that allows hosting

Disadvantage:

* mostly encourages short documents
* mark up language is limited
* editing in ASCII is complex and Web editing is prefered
  

Apache Zeppilin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Web-based notebook that enables data-driven, interactive data
analytics and collaborative documents with SQL, Scala and hadoop. It
integrates a web-based notebook with data ingestion, data exploration,
visualization, sharing and collaboration features to Hadoop and Spark.


Advantages:

* integration to various framework
* Web framework
* integration with spark, hadoop

Disadvantages:

* larger framework
* must leverages existing deployments of spak, hadoop
