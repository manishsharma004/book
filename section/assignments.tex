\chapter{Assignments}\label{c:assignments}

The assignments are listed in chronological order. All
assignments posted here are supposed to be conducted by you. There is
a slight delay between assignments posted in piazza and the
assignments in this section as TAs need to be integrating
them. Typical delay is one business day. Business days are defined as
Mon- Fri 9am - 5pm EST. Thus, it is often better for those working on
the weekends to visit piazza.com instead.

The assignments are ordered by class. Please focus on conducting the
assignments listed either here on in piazza. Just as any textbook has
many exercises, we are providing selected exercises for you as
assignments. Not every exercise mentioned in a chapter has to be done.

\begin{IU}
There can not be any confusion which assignments have been
issued, as they are all pinned in piazza and you can visit piazza.com
to find out which are assigned and listed there.
\end{IU}

If you use a calendar system, it is in your responsibility
to manage it in such a system. This could include Google, Outlook,
CANVAS, and may others.  Naturally you can also use to do lists that
you can manage as part of your github repository issues, once you have
access to. This is probably the preferred method as it allows you to
add the tasks yourself and you can check them on and off as you have
conducted the assignments. 

This way we teach you how to use open source technologies to
coordinate your own work with your own time management tools and
constraints in mind. This is in contrast to just using CANVAS as
CANVAS does not support open source developments in teams. Furthermore
it is unlikely that you will ever use CANVAS after you graduate. We
rather like to have you use systems that you use after you graduate.
However, if you still like to use CANVAS for allerting you, that is
entirely up to you as you can add assignments yourself to CANVAS.

The assignments are listed in reverse chronological order. All
assignments posted here are supposed to be conducted by you. There is
a slight delay between assignments posted in piazza and the
assignments in this section as TAs need to be integrating
them. Typical delay is one buisiness day. However if you work on teh
weekends thsi is not a buisiness day. So for that reason we recommend
that you look always in piazza in addition to this page.

\subsection{New Technology List}
\label{E:616-new-tech}

\begin{exercise} 
Due: Jan 29

The handbook contains a large number of technologies to which an
abstract is provided.

Your task is to identify FIRST not to do an abstract but to
collaboratively gather a LIST of new technologies that are important
in Cloud and Big Data. We suggest doing this in a google docs document
first. Write Lastname, Firstname, class id behind the technology so we
know who contributed it. Indicate also if commercial, or open source,
We are mostly interested in open source activities. Keep the list
sorted by alphabet. Use a bullet so formatting is preserved
