\subsection{Big Data Collaboration}

\begin{exercise} \label{E:big-data-and-collaboration}
{\bf Big data and collaboration.}The purpose of this assignment is multifold; test the ability of Google docs to be used in collaborative fashion by more than a small group and report on the experience. Good Things and bad things, learn on how to use Google docs with headings and table of contents learn how to gather resources quickly with hyperlinks to web resources or articles and translate them into formal academic references. Most importantly convey some very important feature of big data.Contribute this into the handbook for everyone's benefit (done by TAs).
\smallskip

\noindent {\bf Task:} Your task is to identify Big Data size related articles and Web resources and produce a historical development of the growth of this data

\subsection*{Assignment 3: New Technology List}

Due: Jan 29

 

The handbook contains a large number of technologies to which an abstract is provided.

 
\vspace{5mm}
Your task is to identify FIRST not to do an abstract but to collaboratively gather a LIST of new technologies that are important in Cloud and Big Data. We suggest doing this in a google docs document first. Write Lastname, Firstname, class id behind the technology so we know who contributed it. Indicate also if commercial, or open source, We are mostly interested in open source activities. Keep the list sorted by alphabet. Use a bullet so formatting is preserved
