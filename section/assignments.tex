\chapter{Assignments}
\label{c:assignments}

The assignments are listed in chronological order. All assignments
posted here are supposed to be conducted by you. There is a slight
delay between assignments posted in piazza and the assignments in this
section as TAs need to be integrating them. Typical delay is one
business day. Business days are defined as Mon- Fri 9am - 5pm
EST. Thus, it is often better for those working on the weekends to
visit piazza.com instead. The assignments are ordered by class. Please
focus on conducting the assignments listed either here on in
piazza. Just as any textbook has many exercises, we are providing
selected exercises for you as assignments. Not every exercise
mentioned in a chapter has to be done.

\begin{IU}
There can not be any confusion which assignments have been
issued, as they are all pinned in piazza and you can visit piazza.com
to find out which are assigned and listed there.
\end{IU}

If you use a calendar system, it is in your responsibility
to manage it in such a system. This could include Google, Outlook,
CANVAS, and may others. Naturally you can also use to do lists that
you can manage as part of your github repository issues, once you have
access to. This is probably the preferred method as it allows you to
add the tasks yourself and you can check them on and off as you have
conducted the assignments. 

This way we teach you how to use open source technologies to
coordinate your own work with your own time management tools and
constraints in mind. This is in contrast to just using CANVAS as
CANVAS does not support open source developments in teams. Furthermore
it is unlikely that you will ever use CANVAS after you graduate. We
rather like to have you use systems that you use after you graduate.
However, if you still like to use CANVAS for alerting you, that is
entirely up to you as you can add assignments yourself to CANVAS.

\begin{IU}
  All assignments are due Monday morning at 9:00 am est. No exceptions
  unless otherwise specified.

  bio. Comment on the effectiveness of using the cloud service for
  this task. A the end of the document. This assignment does not
  replace the post of the bio to piazza, it is used to gather all bios
  in one document and to evaluate if google docs is a good tool for
  this kind of task. Remember we have lots of students and google is
  used often just with small groups.

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} {\bf Develop an Eve REST Service} due Feb, 2018

See: \url{https://piazza.com/class/jbku81aeli95rz?cid=55}

In this exercise, you will be developing an Eve REST service related
to Cloud Services. We will enhance this assignment throughout the
semester once we have spoken about cloud services in more detail. At
this time you are expected to write a rest service that exposes
information form your computer, such as, processor name, RAM,
Disk. Please identify what information would be useful to have and how
to obtain that information related to your operating
system. Additionally identify how to integrate dynamic data.


\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Assignment catch up: please look at all previous assignments and do
them.

\end{exercise}

\subsection{Swagger}
\begin{exercise}
This is for residential students (The swagger preparation was mentioned last week in class):
 \begin{itemize}
\item (A) you are expected to have done major portions of the Swagger code gen assignment this includes
\subitem (1) pick of a resource you like to implement a rest service for
\subitem (2) read the swagger spec
\subitem (3) complete the spec for the resource as much as possible
\subitem (4) generate the code via swagger codegen
 
This naturally means you need swagger, python and other needed
libraries set up on your machine. We will help refining your
resource. We will help working with you on a simple back-end
implementation that you will improve. You will be using github for all
of this

\smallskip
\item (B) In addition to this I recommend that you
 
\subitem (1) find on the network how to put rasbian on an SD card,
create your self an md file for this as this may be different for
different operating systems.

 
\subitem (2) download rasbian on your machine so you can burn it as you will get 5 sd cards
 
In the lab, those that finish most of the swagger service will switch to building a cloud cluster.
 
\subitem (3) in the lab you will be first thing change the password to
each of them before you put them on the network. Maybe there is a way
to do this directly from your computer after you have put rasbian on
the sd card. But I do not know if that's possible.

 
\subitem (4) figure out how to configure rasbian without a monitor, while just using an SDcard and your laptop, write an md file

 \end{itemize}
 
In case of questions, lets engage in a discussion. If you have md
files for information already in your repo, please post URLs. This
assignment is about openly sharing. Naturally, you should not wait
till someone else does it, you should take leadership yourself.

 
Naturally, focus on the swagger service before starting to get more involved with the cluster
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} {\bf Cloud and Big Data Rest Service with Swagger} due March 5, 2018 Spec before Feb 15, 2018

\begin{itemize}
     
   \item (A) Read the Chapters about REST and Swagger. This includes Swagger specification and Swagger codegen. There
         is also a video that introduces you to Swagger
         \URL{https://youtu.be/0_Ub13py_K8}
 
   \item (B) Read the Document \URL{https://laszewski.github.io/papers/NIST.SP.1500-8-draft.pdf}
 
We will be collaboratively developing a new version of this document while not using examples as in the previous
document but swagger OpenAPI 2.0 specifications.
 
   \item (C) You will pick one of the existing resources or identify a
     new resource that you would like to specify. Simply go to:

\URL{https://docs.google.com/document/d/12FUtHlEzQwxc3hjyki3RbU0iMfBrcyoSMKeq3aEDPk/edit?usp=sharing
} 
and add your name to one of the resource. Make sure there is only one
name for each resource even if you work in a team.
 
   \item (D) For the resource, you chose you will be developing with
     Swagger a useful REST service related to cloud computing and Big
     Data.

 
 \end{itemize}
TAs will provide more details as we will avoid that everyone develops the same service. 
 
You will use this specification create a swagger python service and
implement functions to enable a real implementation of the service
that is useful.

 
Examples:

\begin{itemize}
\smallskip
\item (A) develop a service to upload files to a file system with REST calls.

\item (B) start a cluster of virtual machines on a supercomputer

\item (C) start a cluster of virtual machines on OpenStack

\end{itemize}


Additional resources are listed in the instructor answer. 
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Technology Paper}
\label{E:616-tech-paper}

\begin{exercise} {\bf Technology Paper} due March 20, 2018

\begin{itemize}
Read the following two points to assist you in starting your paper 
\item (A) pick one of the technologies identified by you or if you see a
  hid that has already picked a technology for this assignment you can
  also pick one form that students list also

\item (B) write a LaTeX paper about the technology. Make sure not to
  plagiarize. The maximum number of quotes is about 25\% if
  needed. Please see the scientific writing section

\end{itemize}
 WE RECOMMEND YOU GET STARTED ON THIS RIGHT AWAY AS YOU ALSO WILL HAVE
 TO DO A TUTORIAL AND THE FINAL PROJECT.

Additional details can be found here:
