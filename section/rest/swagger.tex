Swagger \url{https://swagger.io/} is a tool for developing API
specifications based on the OpenAPI Specification (OAS). It allows not
only the specification, but the generation of code based on the
specification in a variety of languages.

Swagger itself has a number of tools which together build a framework
for developing REST services for a variety of languages.


\section{Swagger Tools}

The major Swagger tools of interest are:

\begin{description}

\item[Swagger Core] includes libraries for working with Swagger
 specifications \url{https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core}.

\item[Swagger Codegen] allows to generate code from the specifications
 to develop Client SDKs, servers, and documentation. \url{https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen}

\item[Swagger UI] is an HTML5 based UI for exploring and interacting
 with the specified APIs \url{https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui}

\item[Swagger Editor] is a Web-browser based editor for composing 
 specifications using YAML \url{https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor}

\end{description}

The developed APIs can be hosted and further developed on an
online repository named SwaggerHub \url{https://app.swaggerhub.com/home}
The convenient online editor is available which also can be installed
locally on a variety of operating systems including OSX, Linux, and
Windows.
