\chapter{Assignments}

\section{Overview}
\FILENAME

We will post in this part all assignments for the various classes. As
this page will be updated frequently, it is in the students
responsibility to check.

It is in the
responsibility of the student to check this page and complete the
assignments. Some assignment may not be graded, but they still have to
be completed. To identify the assignment they carry the name of the
Lesson as well as a number. We try to alsoinclude a refernce to the
section where this assignment may be originating from.

The following are mandated assignments for this class

\section{Due Dates}

If not explicitly mentioned here the due dates are posted in Section
\ref{S:calendar}.

\section{Deliverables}

You will have graded assignments as documented in Section
{C:course-2018}. In addition we will post here some additional
assignments, some of which are pass/fail and are integrated in your
disccussion points. You will need to add them to your notebook and if
code is required to include an explicit URL to where that particular
code is in your git repository.
