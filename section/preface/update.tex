\item Ma 29, 2018: Part~\ref{p:incomming} that contains incoming
  tutorials from the class was added. The students the have already
  committed their tutorials in \verb|book/tutorial| must use that
  directory from now on and not submit or copy the tutorials under
  their hid. This is for now valid for all residential students.  For
  online students we have for now just provided a list in
  Chapter~\ref{c:incomming-tutorials}. However best would be if those
  student also start adding the tutorials via a pull request and
  integrate them into the handbook. Some tutorials are obviously in
  draft form, so we like you to complete them. You may have noticed in
  some tutorials we have done significant modification. To simplify
  integration into the handbook we like you to provide the tutorial in
  md. Make sure to place images in an images directory, and bibtex in
  a bib file next to your tutorial. If unclear ask.
