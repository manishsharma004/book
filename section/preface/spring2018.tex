\chapter{Course Policies}\label{C:course-2018}

\FILENAME

\begin{WARNING}
  Although we try to provide an overview of the class we will
  introduce clarifications and improvements in thie documents
  Information will change. Please, revisit frequently. Assignments and
  lectures may be adapted based on experience during this class. The
  requirement of this class stays the same: Become an expert in cloud
  and/or Big Data applications and  technologies.
\end{WARNING}

\begin{IU}

The semester calendar is posted at 

\URL{http://registrar.indiana.edu/official-calendar/official-calendar-spring.shtml}

The class beginns Mon, Jan 8th and ends Fri, May 4th

\end{IU}

Residential students are required to attend all Friday classes
including those held in May.  Missing such classes will result in
grade reduction. Based on past class experience we are foced to
implement a strict strict policy. Only for medical reasons a class can
be missed. The reasoning for this is that residential students that
did not attend classes regularly tend to do not as well in this class
as their colleagues. As we want that you achieve your best we strongly
advise to attend and give with this policy an additional motivating
factor.

\subsection{Notebook}\label{notebook}

Students are required to maintain a \emph{class notebook} in github in
which they summarize their weekly activities for this course. This
includes a self maintained list of which lecture material they viewed.

The notebook is maintained in the class github.com in your hid project
folder. It is a file called notebook.md that uses markdown as format.
While using md, you can either edit it locally and upload to github, or
directly edit it via the git hub Web editor.

You will be responsible to set up and maintaining the notebook.md and
update it accordingly. We suggest that you prepare sections such as:
Logistic, Theory, Practice, Writing and put in bullet form what you have
done into these sections during the week. We can see from the github
logs when you changed the notbook.md file to monitor progress. The
management of the notebook will be part of your discussion grade.

The format of the notebook is very specific and must follow these rules:

\begin{itemize}
\item use headings with the \# character and have a space after the \#
\item use bullets in each topic.
\item each bullet \textbf{must} have an individual date that is of the
  form mm/dd/yy. Please do not lump bullet points under s single
  date. Have each bullet point its own date
\item if you have done the activity in a period than add the second
  date to it mm/dd/yy - mm/dd/yy
\item If you refer to section numbers in your notebook, please aslo
  add the section title as the section numbers may change in case we
  need to add content
\end{itemize}

Please examine carefully the sample note book is available at:

  \URL{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigdata-i523/sample-hid000/master/notebook.md}

This will render inmd as:

  \URL{https://github.com/bigdata-i523/sample-hid000/blob/master/notebook.md}

\subsection{Calendar I524, E616, E516}\label{calendar}

This class is a full term class of 16 weeks.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Jan 8, Mon, Class Begins (see web page)
  \item
  Jan 15, Mon, 9am Setup communication pathways for the class 

  \begin{itemize}
  \item You must have created a github repository in our class
    repository.
  \item You must be in the class Piazza.
  \item Motivation: if we can not communicate with
    you we can not conduct the class. Everyone must be in piazza and
    github timely.  
  \end{itemize}
\item Weekly contribution to piazza or the Handbook
\item Jan 15, MLK Jr. Day. Good day to work on projects, computer setup
\item Jan 22, Mon 9am, Tutorial 1 (Graded)
\item Feb 5,  Mon 9am, Tutorial 2 (Graded)
\item Feb 26, Mon 9am,  Paper 1 (Graded)
\item Spring Break Mar 11 - Mar 18.  
\item Mar 5, Mon 9am, Project Proposal due without panelty
  This is a good time to work ahead or catch up with things. We strongly
  advise to use this time wisely.
\item Mar 16, 9am Project Reports due
\item Mar 23, 9am Improvments to Projects and documents possible, but
  substential work must have been done before to not encounter a grade reduction
\item May 1, Any paper submitted after May 1st will get an
  incomplete. 

\subsection{Incomplete}\label{incomplete}

Incomplete's will receive a fractional Grade reduction. Example A will
become A-, A- will become B+, and so forth. There is enough time in the
course to complete all assignments without getting an incomplete.

Why do we have such a policy? As we teach state-of-the-art software this
software is subject to change, not only within the course, but also
after the course. As we may offer some services and only have access to
the TA's during the semester it is obvious that we like all class
projects and homework assignments to be completed within a semester.
Services that were offered during the semester may no longer be
available after the semester is over and could adversely effect your
planing. It will be in the students responsibility to identify such
services and provide alternatives if they become unavailable. We try
hard to avoid this but we can not guarantee it.

Furthermore, once an incomplete is requested, you will have 10 month to
complete it. We will need 2 month to grade. No grading will be conducted
over breaks. This may effect those that require student loans. Please
plan ahead.

\subsection{Waitlist}\label{waitlist}

The waitlist contains students that are unable to enroll in a section of
a course. Students choose to add themselves to the waitlist. They are
not automatically added, but choose to do so intentionally based on the
status of the course. There are two reasons for students to be on the
waitlist. The first, and primary, reason is that the class is already at
the scheduled, maximum capacity. Since there are no seats available, the
student can elect to add themselves to the waitlist. The second reason
is that the students' own schedule has a time conflict. This occurs when
they are trying to enroll in a class that overlaps with the time of a
class they are already enrolled in.

Students are moved from the waitlist to the regular section during a
daily batch process, and not in real time. The process is not in
realtime because the registrar receives many requests to increase
capacity, decrease capacity, and change rooms. If the process were real
time there would be a catastrophe of conflicts.

Students are moved from the waitlist in chronological order that they
added themselves to the waitlist. If you are still on the waitlist there
are no spaces free, the batch process has not run for the day, or the
student in question has a schedule conflict.

Faculty are not able to selectively choose students from the waitlist.

How long does the waitlist process stay active?: The automated
processing of the waitlist ends on Thursday of the first week of class
At this time the waitlist will no longer be processed. 
As the residential class starts on Friday, this may cause
issues. Either talk to the department on Thursday or show up on
Friday. Most likeley there will be spaces left. 
Students on the waitlist at that time will remain on the waitlist, but remain there
until the student decides to change their registration. Students may not
do that, because they get assessed a change schedule fee.

Students tell me they still want to enroll after the first week of
classes. How do they do this?

Beginning Monday, after the first week of class students begin to use
the eAdd process to do a late addition of the course. The request is
routed to the professor of record on an eDoc and the faculty will be
notified via email. Faculty can deny or approve based on whatever
criteria they wish to apply. If the faculty member approves, the eDoc
is electronically forwarded to the Academic Operations office and we
will approve the late add \textbf{if the room capacity} allows the
addition, otherwise we must deny the addition because of fire marshal
regulations. Many times, there are seats in a
classroom/discussion/lab, but because other students have not
\emph{officially} dropped, enrollment is still at capacity.

After everything, a student that was unable to enroll in the class
attended all year and completed all course work as if they had enrolled.
Can the student get credit and can I give the student a grade?

Yes. There is a provision for a late registration - contact our office
if this occurs. Students will be assessed a tuition fee at the time of
late or retroactive registration.

\subsection{Auditing the class}\label{auditing-the-class}

We no longer allow students to audit I524, E516, and E616. The
motivation to not offer these classes for auditing are:

\begin{itemize}
\item  Typically place in the lecture room
is limited and we want foster students that enroll full time first.

\item The best way to take the class is to conduct a project. As this can
not be achieved without taking the class full time and as auditing the
class does not provide the full value of the class, e.g. not more than
10\% of the class, we do not think it is useful to audit the class.

\item  Accounts and services have to be set up and require
  considerable resources that are not covered by students auditing.

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Resource restrictions}

\begin{itemize}
\item It is not allowed to use our services for profit (e.g. just
  enrolling in the class to use our clouds).
\item In case of abuse of available compute time on our clouds the
  student is aware that we will terminate the computer account on our
  clouds and she may have to conduct the project on a public cloud or
  his own computer under her own cost. There will be no guarantee that
  cloud services we offer will be available after the semester is
  over.  Projects can be conducted as part of the class that do not
  require access to the cloud.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Meeting Times}\label{meeting-times}

The classes are published online. Residential students at Indiana
University will participate in a discussion taking place at the
following time according to the information provided by the registrar.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  09:30A-10:45A Friday I524/E616 residential, I2 150
  11:15A-12:30A Friday I516 residential, I2 150
\end{itemize}

The Monday class has been moved to Friday

\subsection{Office Hours}\label{office-hours}

\begin{description}
\item[Residential Students:]
Residential students participate in the official meeting times. If
additional times are required, they have to be done by
appointment. Office hours will be announced publically. All office
hours are public and can be attended by any student.

Online hours are reserved for online students, residential students
should not use them till not all questions have been answered by online
students.

\begin{itemize}
\item Mon 6:00pm-7:00pm, 7:00pm-8:00pm, Gregor (online)
\item Tue TBD, Smith Research Center
\item Wed TBD, Smith Research Center
\item Thu TBD, Smith Research Center
\item Fri TBD, Smith Research Center
\item Sat TBD, Smith Research Center
\end{itemize}

We suggest that you let the TA's know before you come, in order to make
sure they are at the office.

Residential students can also use the online student meeting times.
However, in that case online students will be served first. It is
probably good to check into the zoom meeting and identify if the TA
has time. They will be in zoom. If a meeting is needed with Gregor,
this is done upon appointment Tue-Thu 10am - 2:30pm. TAs will figure
out if a meeting is needed.  Please prepare your questions ahead of
time, and place them in Piazza first.

If a meeting is needed with Gregor, this is done upon appointment
Tue-Thu 10am - 2:30pm. TAs will figure out if a meeting is needed.
Please prepare your questions ahead of time, and place them in Piazza
first.

Online students can also use the residential student meeting times.
However, in that case residential students will be served first. It is
probably good to check if the TA is free. They will be in zoom.

For more up-to-date details, refer to Piazza.

\section{Plagiarizm}

On teh first dat of class you will need to read the information about
plagiarizm. If there are any questions about plagiarizm we require you
to take a course offered from the educational department.

If we find cheating or plagirizm, your assignment will be receiving an
{\em F}. This especially includes copying text without proper
attribution. In addition you will be receiving an {\em F} for the
appropriate time for the discussion points an assignment was issued,
e.g. If a paper assignment is 4 weeks, you get for these four weeks no
discussion points. Furthermore, we will follow IU policy and report
your case to the dean of students.
