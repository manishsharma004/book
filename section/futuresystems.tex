\chapter{FutureSystems}
\label{C:futuresystems}

\FILENAME

This section gives an overview of the FutureSystems that are available
as part of the DSC infrastructure. We cover the creation of 
FutureSystems Account, Uploading SSH Key and how to
instantiate and log into Virtual Machine and accessing Ipython are
covered. In the end we discuss about running Python and Java on Virtual
Machine.

\section{FutureSystems evolved from FutureGrid}

In this video we introduce FutureGrid a precurser to FutureSystems.

At thsi time we are replacing several of the older systems. To use
these new systems you need to ask for access through them via our portal.


\section{Creating Portal Account}

This lesson explains how to create a portal account, which is the first
step in gaining access to FutureSystems.

See Lesson 4 and 7 for SSH key generation on Linux, OSX or Windows.

\section{SSH Key Generation using ssh-keygen command}
\label{ssh-key-generation-using-ssh-keygen-command}

SSH keys are used to identify user accounts in most systems including
FutureSystems. This lesson walks you through generating an SSH key via
ssh-keygen command line tool.
