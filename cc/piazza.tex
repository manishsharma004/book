The link to Piazza is posted in canvas also on our website but if you case in case you forgot where it is located.


 we simply can type in Google Piazza IUru for Indiana University 2017 I 523 so let's see what happens when we do that and we get here link that shows here 


On the class homepage in Piazza so we go on to this link and here's the information that we have we assume that you have followed on our website the registration information for Piazza and we assume that you are in Piazza we also gave a homework assignment to post a bio and to observe if your bio is being posted not only if you have done that you will be able to see this information as part of the class so one of the things that we have see here is as you see a little bit more information because I'm the teacher and as part of the teacher you have some additional rights such as editing certain features which you don't have but you as a student or we simply seeing seeing a similar homepage but you may not have the rights to edit or delete things one of the things that you can see is this is our description of the class this being posted in our class website we have already showed a video about the class website and you can see the syllabus over here additional information for example on the webpage that's being located in our github page so you can see this if you go to the fork you can see how we are managing our website in github and everything being managed there let's get back to Piazza announcements are being posted in the mountain mountain intersection naturally you can show all announcements that you have or a subset of announcements dependent on what your preferences are and here you will find all announcements including all assignments on all the material that has been posted are going to be posted as a noiseless one additional thing as the sisters you also have here staff directory but we are not using as much as we post the online hours and they support ours in our class website one of the important things is is we have here the resources page the resources page includes all the lectures that have been released typically there's a due date when things have to be read by some some assignments and lectures require that you don't read them immediately some others will give you a little bit more time for this is a recommendation and it would be good if you follow our recommendation by which time you have to read the lectures furthermore one other thing that you see SSS is we also strive to put all the assignments in the resource page so that you for example can click on this particular link we open a new tab here and you would go to that particular assignment in our Piazza main page but as you can see everything is really very well organized including deadlines for certain tasks that we are posting if you don't like our way of managing things in Piazza you have the right to use canvas yourself and you can transfer these tasks into canvas into your own calendar and then you just use canvas by yourself our administrative instructors and myself we will be not using any canvas announcements discussions or calendars everything was being done in Piazza naturally it's obvious why we do this we want to have just one system where things are not too so when we going into Piazza you see also that we have different sections one of the sections is for example the questions and answers the other one is the resources so let's go into a question and answers and Piazza provides you here is a missive you wear a bunch of folders are being listed on top here these are topical folders so if you have a question for example about Python me author publishes that Python if you have something that we have a question about and that we need help this we should be posting it and under help this way we can see quite nicely what's happening on the left-hand side we have all the posts that have currently being posted and now you will say oh there's so many posts I can't figure all what is being posted but the posts are all sorted into folders one of the tasks that you were being asked for assistance for example publish your bio so I can click on the bio folder and I see only by or folder related posts and as you can see is this is they have been corrected sometimes people are posting a wrong folder and we will be correcting it for you there's only one additional post here that you see assignment learn about how folders work there for the class and and this is really a nice post because it includes all the folders and justice and having he end up short cut and bio here above this particular post I can click on bio and I see all the bibliographic information for this particular class one thing is there is an additional tab above all these posts I can for example see now here all the unread posts that I have and apparently I have been real busy and have read every single post you can for example see which posts have been updated and there you can for example see here those welcome message and the Welcome message has been updated and here we have additional posts by by someone and I'm here i showcase you what we are doing to answer a question and here are fsor question it's just the thing we simply say SSSs yes the material is the same and I can go now in and post it and now it's being posted to the to the class there's no difference in regards to the material so when we now look at our updated message this has been updated there are certain other messages that I have not yet looked into I will at one point look into this and here we see for example a number saying is this is how many updates we were being done on to this particular post this way you can identify the posts that are failure for us also important is this and also for you as a student to identify which activities have been resolved and which have not yet been been resolved and here's for example a list of things that I am currently working on and here we have a warning issued before using the proper version of Python here we see a resolved issue and I just answered to this particular question that pycharm is a really good environment for this particular class but you can use not certainly other IDs for developing pythons such as spider or wire clips or or so we don't require you to use Python and however all TAS are required to use Python so they will be able to help you out with PyCharm questions and these are the unresolved questions then in addition to this is there's this feature of following if you have a particular topic that is very interesting to you you can follow this particular question but you can also stop following a particular post and then it will not show up into the following so this way you can organize those posts that you are really highly interested in um so maybe I decided not to follow my my my BIOS that have been posted or some other post that is relevant to your interest and you will no longer receive any updates for this so as you can see this is very easy and one thing to notice is that in order for us to to identify what we are actually posting on Piazza we have in Piazza on our website dear not only a description about how you enroll in Piazza but we also have a description about what folders we actually have and why these waters are and we just walked through the folders that we have come in Piazza logistics is any question that you have we gave regarding the logistic of the course lectures any questions regarding the lectures p1 any questions regarding paper 1 p2 any question regarding paper 2 project io t we will provide you with an option so that you can do an IOT project either it's the main project or as a as a preparation to the main project and we can ask answer questions in this particular folder the term project which is all other projects that we actually have Python questions related to Python PI questions related to Raspberry Pi we will not provide any support for older versions of raspberries a 266 or questions related to the esp8266 the bio all questions regarding the formal bio that you have posted and the bios themselves help in case you need help by a TA or an instructor please use the folder help sometimes people remove help messages to resolved so that we can make sure that we focus on the urgent health messages rather than those that have already been answered in addition we have a discussion folder in which you can ask general questions and and lead discussions we move sometimes messages also from help in into discussion or via deleting posts in folders that are not appropriate and move them in Android discussions there are two special folders that you must not use when you are using Piazza the first this assignments do not click on assignments if you have a question about an assignment you use the folder help this help establish this for us the possibility that you could click on the assignments folder in Piazza and see all homework assignments and will showcase this later the other one is a TA folder this typically is being just used by Kroger in order for him to communicate certain tasks to the TAS and you can you should be using not TA but you should use the help this allows the TAS to say this is ok any message coming in any to TA is from Gregor and it really needs to be urgently handled in addition to urgently handling questions coming from help so this is really simple and in order for you to provide an easy access to all these little folders we are providing this particular post in Piazza that you have already seen with all the different discussions that are relevant for you I had to put the the assignments folder in here and because otherwise it will to show up nicely we need to be registering it also wizard so that's because this is actually an assignment here and as you can see so let's see how do I find out which assignments on have been assigned to me because it's not listed at canvas I press the assignment folder I see all the assignments it cannot be easier we have one system was all assignments in the assignment folder and if there is an issue for example here in one of the posts that I have we see that this particular user has filed a chameleon a question and has used assignments as part of the folder what the TAS will do is they will go into such a question so let's go into the question and they will change the thing to help and remove the assignment for submit this and when I now press the assignments folder again this particular message is no longer coin as you can see this is clean and no students should be using assignment there should be using help instead so as you can see us in bio I see all the bios in help I seen all the help messages that have been submitted in discussions I see all the discussions and sometimes we put a tip in front of the of the node and in the subject line so that we can see this is a tip and you may wonder we dissed it and sometimes you reboot here discussion in there and this should actually be at one point changed to tip so how do you otherwise find assignments well you can type in assignments in the search if you don't like our assignments folder and so you will see an assignment and as you can see is apparently is not fewer and that can go on here and again type in assignments and I find it so you will always find something in regards to this if you misspell assignment which I sometimes do just please go ahead and correct it now the question is is how do I ask a question or create a post let's let's do and we'll do this now if I create a post I can see here the distinction between asking a question and putting a note and notice for example something that you want other people know know a question would be for example how do I ask a question how do I ask a question and I will say is this please ignore please ignore this post so now this is not an assignment but this a question so I have to click on help but I have to unclick the assignment up here I have to now decide if I want to post it to the entire class or to individual instructors let's just say I do it to the entire class and I keep this on and I have a choice to sent a mail immediately or put it into a more beta Q let's just assume I want to send this particular message not to everybody in class but just the instructors then I can click on instructors and this particular post is now only being sent to the instructors I could suddenly put in an individual user here and as you can see I am not even found I am actually part of the instructors even my username is not being found it is so if you come up to contact me please use instructors don't use my name so in order for me now to post this I post my question to the instructor list now I as an instructor can post an answer it's also to say this is a test showcase I


I can post it I can naturally correct spelling errors by doing the Edit action here feel free to just go in there and do spelling our corrections and but sometimes this discussion can be very very long so what I can do is is I can create a summary answer it is simple please about Piazza and then at one point I put in here a URL I haven't published this yet so I can update this particular answer and another not the time to put here the URL and if you think this is a good answer you can also simply say however this is a good answer and you see some some posts we'll have many good answers and you can actually even undo it if you feel like this is not a good answer so this is how you post this was a question you can also transfer them a crushin into a node or you can transfer a node to a question so this is fairly straightforward and therefore we are able to support all of you with your help because not only we are required to provide an answer but also we expect that the students provide an answer and that's how you obtain discussion points that go ahead into your discussion is so that you help us improving the support not only by then structures but built the community similar what we are doing in residential classes in the residential class I present material and students ask questions I answer the questions student engage with us during that discussion and provide themselves answers to our questions that we have and and thus obtain positive feedback in for example a class setting business as you can see is this Piazza's really simple and allows us to be fairly scalable in the way we are answering the teaching assistants are required to monitor all posts and correct folder settings correct the proper placement and into a folder and are required to answer your questions to the best of their ability but in many cases us students can contribute to this because we have such a diverse set of students was very excellent background that you can very well contribute to this effort that we have once we find that answer it's really wonderfully formulated we may take this answer put it into the our web class website and to replace the link in the answer with a link to our class website so that we can make sure we have only one location where our answers are being collected in the long run and we can point to answers into the class website when you go to the class website naturally you have a search capability as you can see and if I have for example a question about Piazza Piazza I can't search for it Vanessa kids uses I misspelled Piazza so let's do it again so I can see all the locations where Piazza has been mentioned and this is naturally a lot because not only that you are also showing up but potentially other places show up all of us that have numbers and font typically the ones that are associated with our class and so you can for example go ahead and Indian to the section and as you can see is here's our explanation of our Piazza business I think I have given you enough information about Piazza to become really successful contributors to the class
