## Travis CI
### Repository Build status 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/seashiva94/hid-sp18-503.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/seashiva94/hid-sp18-503)

Travis CI is a continuous integration service that syncs with github
and allows developers to automate the process of testing an deploying
code.  Travis CI allows users to test code for various different
environments and allows the use of various languages, which can be
easily specified by adding a travis.yml file in the repository.

This tutorial explores testing for python.

* First requirement to use Travis CI is to have a github account Next
* create an account on the trais CI website or login using your github
* account and alow travis to sync the repositories <a href ="https://travis-ci.org/auth?redirectUri=https%3A%2F%2Ftravis-ci.org%2Fauth%3FredirectUri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Ftravis-ci.org%252F">  here </a>.
* Next select the repository that you want to use with Travis-CI on
  travis website
* Go to github and locally clone the repository.

### The .travis.yml file

The .travis.yml file describes to travis, which language is used, what environments to test the code on, and to install any dependencies that may be required.

* The first line of the yml file specifies the language used

```
language: python
```

* Next we need to specify the versions of python we need to test the code for.
  Here we need to specify the versions in the same manner as we use to
  install the language, as travis creates a virtual environment for each of
  these versions.
  
  ```
  python:
    - 3.6.4
  ```

* Dependencies can be specified in the yml file under using he ```install:```
  tag. It is recommended that the dependencies be installed using pip as travis
  creates a virtual environment for each python version.
  
  ```
  install:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```    

* If tests should be perfrmed for different versions of libraries,
  such as django for each python version, then ```env:``` tag can be used
  along with the ```install``` tag.
  
  ```
  env:
    - django_version=1.10
    - django_version=1.11
  install:
    - pip install Django==$django_version
  ```

* finally to specify what commands to execute to run the tests,
  we use the ```script:``` tag. If a makefile is used for this purpose,
  this can be done a follows however travis allows the use of pytest for
  this pupose as well.

  ```
       script: make test
  ```
* Travis allows various srvices to be run as required at the time of testing.
  This can be enabled using the ```services``` tag in the yml file. To start a
  mongodb service for testing your code on travis add the following to the yml file
  ```
  services:
    - mongodb
  ```
  
* To show, and keep track of the build status of the repository, travis allows users to add build status
  badges in the markdown file. Once a test is complete, click on the badge on the travis page, and
  select markdown. Then copy the markdown code and add it to the required markdown file.
  On subsequent pushes to the repository, this status keeps updating.

### An Example.
  
To showcase the use of travis, the .travis.yml file in this repository
uses a make file (test_build) to test the swagger code. Swagger auto generates basic
tests that check for correct response codes as specified in the swagger 
specification yml file.
The .travis.yml file specifies that mongodb is needed for testing.
The  script tag in .travis.yml file invokes the make command which in turn
performs the following steps.

* It dowmloads swagger cli
* It uses the swagger/Makefile to generate the swagger code and install requirements
* It install test requirements provided by swagger
* It uses pytest to perform tests that were generated by swagger
* Finally it cleans the repository.
